<pre>Play is one of the most important means for child development.

At a very young age, children play to explore the physical world around them, while at the same time challenging their fine and gross motor skills.

The toys they are most happy to play with are of a physical nature, stimulating to the senses.
 
Later on, children play as a means to develop social skills. 

They learn to win and to lose, to reason with others, to be sportsmanlike, etc.while playing games outside on the playground or board games.
 
They might also reenact parts from adult life to incorporate the values and norms of the culture, such as when children play house.

Playing with toys is an important part of aging. 

Younger children use toys to discover their identity, help with cognition, learn cause and effect, explore relationships, become stronger physically, and practice skills needed in adulthood. 

Adults on occasion use toys to form and strengthen social bonds, teach, help in therapy, and to remember and reinforce lessons from their youth. 

Playing with toys can be an enjoyable way of training young children for life experiences.

Different materials like wood, clay, paper, and plastic are used to make toys.

Newer forms of toys include interactive digital entertainment and smart toys.

Some toys are produced primarily as collectors' items and are intended for display only.
